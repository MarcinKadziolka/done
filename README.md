# Description
Application provides simplistic, yet pretty graphical user interface for easier managment of tasks in provided text file, formatted by the rules of the todo.txt.
Goal of this project is to provide the necessary functionality and smooth usage with addition of good looking themes.
Motivation was not being able to find a compromise between looks, functionality and keyboard-driven approach in other existing apps.

Application is written in Python with kivy and kivyMD library.

As of right now app, while providing full basic functionality, is not fully developed and there are possible features to add.
